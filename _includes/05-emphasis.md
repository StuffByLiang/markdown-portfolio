Hi! I'm a self-driven **entrepreneur**, innovative **full-stack developer**, and **leader**. I have an *extensive portfolio* of personal projects using a wide array of technical stacks, as well as experience leading teams. My current interests are entrepreneurship, business administration, machine learning, application development, as well as the world of fintech, specifically open banking. I've always had a constant desire to learn new technologies, and over the years, I have strived to gain as much industry knowledge that relates to my interests as I can. Apart from that, I play Ultimate Frisbee and do lots of other extracurricular activities. Feel free to take a look around my website, view my resume or contact me!
